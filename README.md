This is an effort to explore the AST module in Python. 
Code 2 to Code 8 have the same AST functions written that are being run for different ASTs. 
Code 9 is a more complex code where I am observing the AST by typing out the mentioned command on the terminal.
Code 10 and Code 11 have a function that compares the 2 ASTs.
